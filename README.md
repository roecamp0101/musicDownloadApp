## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. 
    
**Verify that you are running at least node `v5.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.


Clone this repo into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC) > 
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/roeroeC0101/music-download-app
  
```

    Open folder music-download-app in git bash
    cd > Desktop > music-download-app


## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**.

  npm install > npm start
  
```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
